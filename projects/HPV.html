      <h1>HPV Vaccination Research</h1>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Application of the Health Belief Model (HBM)</h2>
        <p>
          Used the HBM framework to analyze HPV vaccine discourse on social
          media, focusing on core HBM constructs: perceived susceptibility,
          severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          By mapping these constructs to real-world Twitter narratives, assessed
          how individuals perceive the HPV vaccine’s importance, benefits, and
          barriers, identifying critical factors in vaccine hesitancy and
          acceptance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Developing a GPT-Driven Data Identification Tool</h2>
        <p>
          Created the GPT-HBM Program, a Python-based tool leveraging the OpenAI
          API and GPT-4 model, to automate the classification of social media
          posts according to HBM variables. This tool allowed analysis of large
          datasets with greater speed and accuracy, reducing human labor
          typically required for data coding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Experimenting with Prompt Engineering for Model Accuracy</h2>
        <p>
          Applied an experimental approach to prompt engineering, refining the
          model’s handling of nuanced HBM variables by tailoring prompts based
          on specific health belief constructs. This process included iterative
          testing, reviewing, and adjusting prompts to address model
          performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensured high Krippendorff’s alpha scores (0.87 - 0.96) in alignment
          with human coders, enhancing the model’s capacity for interpreting
          complex constructs like perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Time Series Analysis of HPV Vaccine Discourse</h2>
        <p>
          Applied time series analysis to study the influence of public health
          events, such as Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, on behavioral
          tendencies related to HPV vaccination. Findings indicated limited
          impact from such campaigns, as behavior patterns on social media
          didn’t show significant shifts towards increased vaccine uptake during
          these periods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Descriptive and Regression Analysis of HBM Constructs</h2>
        <p>
          Conducted descriptive analysis and regression modeling to assess the
          prevalence and relationships between HBM variables. Highlighted
          perceived severity and benefits as dominant themes in the discourse,
          while perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy were less frequently
          mentioned, pointing to areas where public education may need
          strengthening.
