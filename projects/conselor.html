        </h2>
        <p>
          Conducted over 100 counseling sessions with clients from marginalized
          communities, including elderly residents in nursing homes and middle
          school students. The sessions focused on emotional recovery and
          resilience-building, addressing the unique emotional challenges posed
          by the COVID-19 pandemic and providing a safe environment for clients
          to process their experiences.

          Observation and Identification of Social and Emotional Challenges in
          Middle School Students Post-Pandemic
        </h2>
        <p>
          Observed two main challenges in middle school students following a
          year of quarantine and online learning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A lack of social intelligence, which hindered their ability to
            interact meaningfully with peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delayed development in self-expression, evident in their struggles
            to communicate effectively and connect with classmates.

          social skills and stronger peer relationships.
