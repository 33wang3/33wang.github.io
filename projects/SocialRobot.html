          <h2>Designing a Social Robot</h2>
          <h3>Enhancing Social-Emotional Skills</h3>
          <p>
            Created a social robot that facilitates a digital group game aimed at supporting individuals with lower self-disclosure abilities or limited social skills. The goal of the intervention is to connect participants, promote interpersonal closeness, and encourage self-disclosure and verbal expression in a group setting.

          <h2>Game Design Framework</h2>
          <h3>Using Social Penetration and Self-Disclosure Theories</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a conceptual framework for the game based on Social Penetration and Self-Disclosure Theories, encouraging gradual self-revelation and meaningful connections among participants. The social robotâ€™s role is tailored to provide prompts, guide reflection, and create a supportive environment for engagement.
          </p>
          <h3>Incorporating the Emotion-Memory Cognitive Model</h3>
          <p>
            Designed the game framework using image-based emotional stimuli structured for complex emotional processing. The emotional stimuli are developed with nuanced emotional blends (e.g., 30% happy, 20% unhappy, 10% neutral) to engage participants in deeper emotional and cognitive experiences.

          <h2>Evaluation Approach</h2>
          <h3>Mixed-Method Design</h3>
          <p>
            Implemented a mixed-method approach to evaluate the game's impact on social-emotional connection and mental well-being. The evaluation captures both quantitative and qualitative data on interpersonal connectedness and participants' perceptions of the social robot's roles: facilitator, educator, and therapeutic agent.

          <h2>Identity Support Game</h2>
          <h3>For Marginalized Adolescent Immigrants</h3>
          <p>
            Developing a chatbot-facilitated game grounded in identity development and self-affirmation theories to support adolescent immigrants. The game uses self-reflective exercises and guided identity exploration to help participants clarify their self-concept and navigate the complexities of their identities, fostering resilience and empowerment.
