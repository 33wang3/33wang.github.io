          Observing Public Anger and Criticism on Social Media at the Onset of
          the Pandemic
        </h2>
        <p>
          At the start of the pandemic, there was widespread public anger on
          Chinese social media, with people expressing frustration over the
          government’s handling of the crisis. Many felt that the concealment of
          information led to unnecessary loss of life, and there was strong
          criticism of what people saw as inadequate government responses and
          measures.

        <h2>
          Identifying the “COVID-19 War” Narrative as a Reconciliation Tool
        </h2>
        <p>
          Over time, the initial anger on social media began to soften as a new
          narrative emerged—the “COVID-19 war” narrative. This narrative became
          a powerful tool for reconciling public sorrow and anger, transforming
          the crisis into a story of national resilience and collective effort
          against a common enemy.

          Master’s Thesis Research on Collective Psychology and Wartime Framing
        </h2>
        <p>
          I explored this topic in my master’s thesis at NYU, focusing on how a
          wartime narrative could help reconcile public emotions through the
          lens of collective psychology. My research examined how collective
          grief and frustration could be reframed into a sense of shared
          sacrifice and duty, offering psychological closure and purpose.

          Data Collection and Analysis of Chinese Social Media Content on Weibo
        </h2>
        <p>
          For my research, I gathered data from official Chinese social media
          accounts on Weibo. Using topic modeling, I was able to identify
          specific themes that framed the virus as an “enemy” and positioned the
          public health management team as “soldiers.”

          Findings: Reframing Sorrow and Loss as Necessary Sacrifice for
          National Resilience
        </h2>
        <p>
          My findings revealed that the wartime narrative shifted the perception
          of personal loss into a necessary sacrifice for the nation’s greater
          good. This narrative allowed individual sorrow to be integrated into a
          broader story of resilience, aligning personal experiences with the
          collective psychology of national endurance.
