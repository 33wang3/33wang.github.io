        <h2>Personal Social Robot Built on a Multi-Layered Model</h2>
        <p>
          This project involves the creation of a social robot designed to act
          as a digital representation of myself, incorporating advanced Natural
          Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a multi-layered response
          system. The goal is to ensure that the chatbot not only delivers
          accurate and detailed information but also reflects my tone, thoughts,
          and personality as authentically as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Three-Layer Model</h2>
        <p>
          To provide nuanced and personalized responses, the robot operates on a
          three-layered model:
        </p>

        <h3>Layer 1: Prompt-Answer Matching</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The system quickly checks if the user’s query matches a pre-defined
            prompt-answer pair using a rule-based NLP combined with a
            lightweight classifier for prompt matching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Matches user input to a curated set of prompt-answer pairs for fast
            and accurate responses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Layer 2: Full Statement Access</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If no match is found, the system processes the query in the context
            of a full personal statement containing all relevant background and
            experience information, enabling broader and deeper responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Purpose</b>: Generates nuanced and contextually rich answers when
            Layer 1 cannot resolve the query.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Layer 3: Database Retrieval</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If the query cannot be resolved in Layers 1 or 2, the system
            accesses a database of structured data, including project details,
            contact information, and academic papers. Integrating a structured
            JSON database and optional full-text search (e.g., Elasticsearch).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Purpose and Vision</h2>
        <p>
          The design ensures that users receive responses that are both specific
          and reflective of my personal tone and perspective. By leveraging this
          multi-layered approach, the social robot becomes a true digital
          manifestation of me—representing my thoughts, personality, and values
          as closely as possible. This project exemplifies how AI and
          conversational systems can create deeply personalized digital
          presences, enhancing connection and understanding in human-robot
          interactions.
