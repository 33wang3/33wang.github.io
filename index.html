            Hi, I'm Jessy Wang, a second-year Ph.D. student in Emerging Media Studies at Boston University. 
            My work focuses on the psychological determinants of human-computer interaction, leveraging computational, qualitative, 
            and community participatory design methods to develop digital tools that address real-world mental health challenges.
            I aim to ensure that technology is not only innovative but also adapted to solve practical problems in ways that drive social justice.

                <b>Abstract</b>: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection remains a
                global public health concern, with persistently low vaccination
                rates contributing to significant health risks. Despite previous
                research on HPV vaccine perceptions, challenges in large-scale
                data analysis and achieving ideal accuracy persist. To address
                this gap, this study developed a GPT-Health Belief Model (HBM)
                program to efficiently annotate HPV-related discourse on
                Twitter. Through text labeling and time series analysis of 5,575
                tweets, this study elucidates distinct patterns and dynamic
                relationships within public health beliefs, particularly in the
                context of vaccination. The application of large language
                models, including GPT, demonstrated high reliability, achieving
                Krippendorff's alpha scores between 0.87 and 0.96, which
                underscores the model's accuracy in classifying nuanced health
                communication data. Time series analysis revealed temporal
                relationships among the components of the Health Belief Model
                (HBM) and behavioral tendencies. These analyses highlight the
                potential of advanced statistical techniques to uncover the
                temporal dynamics that shape public discourse and attitudes
                toward health behaviors over time. This approach demonstrates
                the potential of GPT-based models to enhance understanding of
                health beliefs in social media discourse.

                <b>Abstract</b>: With the development of technologies, 3D
                websites, which display dynamic and interactive virtual
                environments on the screen, emerged as an innovative marketing
                tool. Despite previous research has explored the effectiveness
                of 3D websites on consumer behaviors, few studies have examined
                the potential mediation effect of spatial presence in such
                effectiveness. Aiming to fill this research gap, the current
                study conducted two pre-registered experiments. By comparing the
                effect of 3D websites to static 2D websites in a commercial
                (Experiment 1) and a non-commercial context (Experiment 2), we
                found that 3D websites could elicit users’ feelings of
                entertainment (i.e., enjoyment and appreciation) and a greater
                purchase intention through spatial presence. These results
                validate the value of 3D websites as a marketing tool and shed
                light on a possible underlying mechanism. The theoretical and
                practical implications are further discussed.

                <b>Abstract</b>: This study is part of a broader research
                project exploring the design of a social robot that facilitates
                a digital group game intervention aimed at enhancing
                participants’ social-emotional skills and mental well-being. At
                this stage, the research focuses on developing a digital
                visual-emotional-stimuli-based group game, StEMory (Stimulated
                Emotional Memory), bringing participants’ emotional safety to
                self-disclose, and fostering trust and interpersonal closeness
                in group settings. A mixed-method design has been implemented to
                measure the significance of game effects and explore users’
                underlying psychological key for group interpersonal
                connectedness, as well as their views on the potential role a
                social robot could play in facilitating the game. A key design
                feature of the game is the adoption of the emotion-memory
                cognitive model while implementing complex emotional images for
                deeper cognitive processing. Within a theoretical framework
                built upon psychological theories, the study findings indicate a
                significant increase in both interpersonal closeness and
                individual-level willingness to engage in self-disclosure. This
                study also establishes a foundation for future CSCW research by
                developing a design guide for integrating a social robot into
                the group social-emotional intervention.

                <b>Abstract</b>: This study explores the integration of an
                embodied social robot within a hybrid in-person and digital
                group game designed to enhance social-emotional skills and
                foster group bonding among participants. Building upon existing
                theoretical frameworks, we examine the potential roles for
                embodied social robots—therapeutic, educational, and
                facilitative—each aimed at strengthening social-emotional
                connections within a structured, interactive game environment. A
                mixed-method design involving pre- and post-surveys and
                Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)--based assessments will
                evaluate how each robot role influences user experience,
                perceived bonding, and emotional engagement. The study result
                will contribute to the theoretical extension of Computers as
                Social Actors (CASA) and empirical applications of embodied
                social robot design in a group setting.

                <b>Abstract</b>: This experimental study investigates how
                self-disclosure by virtual agents sparks emotional engagement.
                Specifically, the extent of self-disclosure (high or low) and
                the modality (text-only or voice-inclusive) are manipulated to
                examine the effectiveness under different conditions. Emotional
                engagement was measured biometrically, including heart rate and
                skin conductance. Preliminary analysis reveals that a virtual
                agent with personal-related text disclosure and voice gains the
                most emotional engagement from users, though it also has the
                highest tendency to bring the cognitive load. While the current
                data supports informative analysis, data collection is still in
                progress to strengthen the statistical significance of
                identified trends. Further analysis that will allow more probing
                for insights will be conducted prior to the 2025 ICA conference.
                This research is expected to provide insights into the design
                and adoption of virtual agents in tasks requiring emotional
                connection.
